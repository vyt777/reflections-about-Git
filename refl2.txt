What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- git init creates a new repository. It creates .git directory with some metadata info, it is needed for future commiting and tracking history of commits of the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the staging area is like the area for preparing files which will be committed. It offer the possibility to make changes and do some experimental work until there are well-prepared files for making a commitment.
